I asked chatGPT "can you think of a good name for a product that's [Spiral Dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57yBla5JI9k) and [Elizabeth April](https://elizabethapril.com) combined?"

# Mashup Video from a channel

Is there a youtube channel that you've seen many, many episodes of and are kinda an expert

For me it's

[Sam Sulek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Sam_Sulek) and
[Elizabeth April](https://www.youtube.com/@ElizabethApril)

and a few others but the point is as I'm watching these videos I really want to hit
pause and record the exact timecode I'm at so I can clip a good 9 second point someone just made.
