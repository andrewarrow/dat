I asked chatGPT "can you think of a good name for a product that's [Spiral Dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57yBla5JI9k) and [Elizabeth April](https://elizabethapril.com) combined?"

And Dynamic April Transcendence (DAT) came back.

# Mashup Video from a channel

Is there a youtube channel that you've seen many, many episodes of and are kinda an expert

For me it's

[Sam Sulek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Sam_Sulek) and
[Elizabeth April](https://www.youtube.com/@ElizabethApril)

and a few others but the point is as I'm watching these videos I really want to hit
pause and record the exact timecode I'm at. This is so I can clip a short ~9 seconds of video because someone just made a good pointi and I don't want to lose it. After I'm done with a 30 min video I have a bunch of these timecodes.

```
yt-dlp --download-sections "*3:25-3:32" --merge-output-format mp4  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57yBla5JI9k"
```
